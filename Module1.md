# Cloud Computing – On-demand delivery of IT resources over the interned with pay-as-you-go pricing

The request is made by the client; the server responds to that request after processing it.
Key concept: “You only pay for what you use”
-	Can access resources within seconds
-	Wide array of information technology assets
-	Can access from anywhere with internet connection
-	Flexible pricing


## Cloud deployment types
1.	Cloud-based
Migrate your existing resources to the cloud, design and build new applications within the cloud environment
2.	On-premises
Provides dedicated resources and low latency, doesn’t provide many of the cloud benefits
3.	Hybrid/multi-cloud
Cloud-based + On-premises. Ideal where legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements


## Benefits of the Cloud
Benefit #1:  Trade fixed expense for variable expense
Benefit #2:  Benefit from massive economies of scale
Benefit #3:  Stop guessing capacity
Benefit #4:  Increase speed and agility
Benefit #5:  Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres
Benefit #6:  Go global in minutes


## AWS Global Infrastructure
-	AWS Regions – minimum of 3 physically separate AZ within a geographic area
-	Availability zones(AZ) – one or more data centres with redundant power, networking, and connectivity around the world

High availability – applications stay accessible with minimal down time, if one system fails, another is ready
Fault tolerance – system keeps running even if multiple components fail


## The AWS Shared Responsibility Model
AWS = security of the cloud:
-	Protecting the infrastructure that runs all the services offered
Hardware, software, networking, facilities that run AWS Cloud services
Customer = security in the cloud:
-	Which data they store on AWS
-	Who has access to that data
-	How access to the data is granted, managed and revoked
-	Client-side encryption
Shared responsibilities:
-	Server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform and application management , and OS, network, firewall configuration.
